# 404 Embassy Atlas v1.0

**The 404 Embassy Atlas is an open-source, dynamic database mapping the emerging ecosystem of network states, charter cities, DAOs, and other para-political entities. This repository serves as the single source of truth for the project.**

The world of governance is fragmenting and rebundling. New forms of sovereignty are being prototyped in digital communities and physical enclaves. The language is confusing, the players are diverse, and the landscape is uncharted.

We needed a map. So we built one.

This Atlas is curated by [404Embassy](https://embassy.svit.la/), a research studio and newsletter documenting the rise of network societies. It is built upon the **Embassy Protocol for Network Cartography (EPNC) v1.1**, a standardized methodology for classifying and analyzing these new entities.

## üó∫Ô∏è The Live Atlas

The data in this repository powers our interactive visualizations. You can explore the live map here:
https://observablehq.com/@404embassy-atlas/ver1

The map plots entities across two primary axes:
*   **X-Axis (Modus Operandi):** Narrative (-1.0) ‚Üî Protocol (+1.0)
*   **Y-Axis (Genesis Locus):** Emergent (-1.0) ‚Üî Architected (+1.0)

This allows for a clear visualization of the strategic clusters and ideological fault lines within the ecosystem.

## üß¨ The EPNC Protocol

Our analysis is not arbitrary. Every entity in this Atlas is assessed against a rigorous, multi-layered protocol.

*   **Layer 1: Foundational Coordinates:** An entity's position in a 3D conceptual space (Modus Operandi, Genesis Locus, Sovereignty Gradient).
*   **Layer 2: Functional Profile:** An entity's operational reality (Identity, Primary Vectors, Scale, Signal Markers).

A full description of the EPNC v1.1 protocol can be found in our [Protocol Documentation](https://link-to-your-substack-post-explaining-the-protocol.com).

## ü§ù How to Contribute

The Atlas is a living document. We welcome contributions from the community.

1.  **Suggest a New Entity:** Do you know of a project that should be on this map? Open an [Issue](https://github.com/raysvitla/404-embassy-atlas/issues) using the "New Entity Proposal" template.
2.  **Correct an Existing Profile:** Do you believe a score is inaccurate or data is outdated? Open an [Issue](https://github.com/raysvitla/404-embassy-atlas/issues) with your suggested change and supporting evidence.
3.  **Improve the Protocol:** Have ideas for improving the EPNC protocol itself? Start a discussion.

This is not just a repository; it's a public utility for understanding the future of governance.
